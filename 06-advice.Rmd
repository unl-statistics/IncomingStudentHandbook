# Advice from Current Graduate Students {#advice}

What is one good tip you were given prior to Grad School?

- "Relax the summer before"
- "Don't stress about results, just enjoy the experience"
- "You will definitely be overwhelmed considering that it is a big leap from the undergrad studies. But everything will be fine"
- "MEAL PREPPING!"
- "Stay connected with others and the department"
- "Have a great balance between work and life. That means that no one should study ALL the time. Finding a hobby or hobbies will help with the stress of graduate school."
- "You might need to re-learn how to study/do homework. It's a lot different from undergraduate!"
- "Don't take everything too seriously"
- "Make sure to make time for fun"
- "All the students are in this together. Work together. Ask each other questions. Help each other."
- "There will come a time in class where you will have no clue what is going on. Don't panic, you are probably not the only one. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your classmates or professors."
- "Make sure to allocate proper time for sleep (ie. choose sleep over cramming)"
- "Have a personal life. It's healthy to have a balance!"

What is something you wish you had known before moving to Lincoln and beginning graduate school?

- "Should keep very organized notes that I can refer to later in the semester"
- "Managing a balanced life"
- "Public transport is not great, it would be useful to find housing near bus routes or have your own car."
- "Lot of outdoor activities conducted by UNL outdoor adventure center, great way to make new friends who enjoy doing the same things as you. Beer tours at Zipline - good way of making friends outside of your academic circle. Lot of events are organized by different international students organizations - Malaysia night, India night, good way to meet new people."
- "It's very important to form a cohort, even if that's not the people starting at the same time as you. Form study groups, find people you can ask questions or get advice from. Grad school is a collaborative experience!"
- "know and constantly communicate with everyone in your cohort. Makes everything easier"
- "Making new friends takes effort. Work hard to deepen friendships. Also, they don't plow residential roads."
- "Enjoy this time to learn and meet new friends. Many people will be your future colleagues and those who will remain in your life for the extended future."
- "Get creative with your coursework and projects. Take classes in the computer science, or economics department. Don't just stick with the normal classes. Go above and beyond."
- "This experience is what you make of it. If you don't put in the work to get to know your fellow students and faculty, and attend events hosted by either the gsa or department, the experience probably won't be as fun. It's also a chance to network with people who will be your peers."
