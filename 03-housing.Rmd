Most students seemed to have found an apartment by just googling "apartments in Lincoln", or looking through apartment rental sites like Zillow. Many apartments have been built in recent years, so it is pretty easy to find one (according to a student, you probably don't even have to start looking until 30-60 days in advance). 

Here is the Information Page from Grad Studies about relocating to Lincoln for more helpful information: https://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/admissions/relocate

If you are interested in finding a roommate:

- Reach out to one of the Stat GSA officers and we will send out a message to see if any current students are looking for a roommate. Not gauranteed, but we will do our best to help connect you.
- University of Nebraska Facebook Page
- UNL CSSA (Chinese Student and Scholar Association) - has page on UNL website and a Facebook page.
- If you are from India, the Indian Student Association (who has a facebook page) can help potentially connect you with a roommate and potential places to live. 
- Also, there's been multiple instances of people starting off by living alone, then moving in with friends they make in the department. So that may be an option later.  


## Furniture

If you are in need of some new/used furniture, here are some recommendations:

- Facebook marketplace
- OfferUp is a good app to find used furniture.
- UNL CSSA Facebook Page
- UNL Buy and Sell Facebook Page
- Goodwill
- Ernie's in Ceresco
- Craigslist
- Walmart
- Target
- Furniture Row
- Amazon: will probably have to do your own assembling, but a good option if you don't have a car
- Nebraska Furniture Mart: located in Omaha and is a bit more on the expensive side compared to these other places, but it's really nice new furniture. It is a set of multiple buildings, and there is a clearance building called Mrs. B's with discounted furniture. In most cases, for an additional fee, they can ship it to Lincoln and bring it into your housing for you.
