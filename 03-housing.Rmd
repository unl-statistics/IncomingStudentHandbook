Most students seemed to have found an apartment by just googling "apartments in Lincoln", or looking through apartment rental sites like Zillow. Please be aware that there are some apartment complexes that will not allow you to rent an apartment without first visiting it, but there are places that will. 

If you are interested in finding a roommate:

- Reach out to one of the Stat GSA officers and we will send out a message to see if any current students are looking for a roommate. Not gauranteed, but we will do our best to help connect you.
- University of Nebraska Facebook Page
- If you are from India, the Indian Student Association (who has a facebook page) can help potentially connect you with a roommate and potential places to live. 


## Furniture

If you are in need of some new/used furniture, here are some recommendations:

- Facebook marketplace
- UNL CSSA Facebook Page
- UNL Buy and Sell Facebook Page
- Goodwill
- Craigslist
- Walmart
- Target
- Furniture Row
- Amazon: will probably have to do your own assembling, but a good option if you don't have a car
- Nebraska Furniture Mart: located in Omaha and is a bit more on the expensive side compared to these other places, but it's really nice new furniture. It is a set of multiple buildings, and there is a clearance building called Mrs. B's with discounted furniture. In most cases, for an additional fee, they can ship it to Lincoln and bring it into your housing for you.
