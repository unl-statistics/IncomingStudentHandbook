## Night Life
- The Railyard: Across the street from Pinancle Bank Arena and has typically has live music on the weekends and watch parties for certain sporting events. Turns into an outdoor ice skating rink in the winter. Many events are hosted around here in the summer. 
- The Haymarket: bar and restaurant district
- Many other bars on O and P street. 

If you are a TA, the advice I was given on my tour was if you were worried about seeing your students while you were out, then stick to bars in the Haymarket area. 

## Activities

### Sporting Events:
\begin{itemize}
\item Nebraska Cornhuskers
\begin{itemize}
\item Nebraska does not have any professional sports teams, so the locals tend to be pretty crazed for all things Huskers. I would not recommend trying to study on City Campus while there is a football game happening as there will be lots of people and no place to park
\item Most home sporting events at UNL are free with your student ID. This includes baseball, softball, track and field, gymnastics, women's basketball, women's soccer, and wrestling. Please see the athletic departments website (linked below) for a full list of sports and their schedules. Sometimes will give away free items, like tshirts. 
\item Football, Men's Basketball and Volleyball are the three sports that you have to have student season tickets for. Typically information for securing student tickets goes out during the spring semester before the next academic school year. If you are unable to secure student season tickets or don't want to commit to a full season, check out The Iron N Student Ticket Exchange Facebook group. This is a place where students can sell a single game ticket if they are unable to attend. The ticket tab on the athletic department website will lead you to the student ticket portal where you would need to create an account to buy tickets and accept transferred tickets from another student. I recommend trying to attend a football game or volleyball game at least once while you are here even if you aren't a huge sports fan. It is defintely a Nebraskan cultural experience and great for people-watching! The volleyball team is typically ranked within the top 10 nationally and won a national championship in 2017. The football team is just trying to have a winning season at this point, but the games are still fun to attend.

\end{itemize}
\item Lincoln Saltdogs: A member of the South Division of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball
\item Omaha Stormchasers: Triple-A affliate of the Kansas City Royals. About a 45 minute drive from Campus but typically have fun theme nights. For Sunday home games you can sit in the grass for free if you bring 3 nonperishable Hyvee-labeled food items
\item Lincoln and Omaha also tend to host random sporting events throughout the year, so if you are interested be on the lookout for those. The Men's College World Series is held in Omaha each June, and even if you can't get into the game the beer gardens around the stadium can be fun. 
\end{itemize}

### Outdoor Activities: 
- Any of the lakes or parks (for example Holmes Lake)

- There are a few state parks within a 30 minute drive of Lincoln (for example, Branched Oak, Mahoney and Platte River) that have trails, camping and other activities. 
- Pioneer's Park Nature Center
- Farmer's Markets (there is one in the Haymarket then tends to run from like May to October, google it to find more info)
