\hypertarget{course-schedule}{%
\section{Course Schedule}\label{course-schedule}}

A full-time graduate student typically takes about 9 credits per semester. This summer you will need to register for your Fall 2021 courses. Typically first semester courses are already selected for you with flexibility in electives later on in the program. During this upcoming semester, you will want to make sure you are registered for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Stat 821: Statistical Methods I (3 Credits)
\item
  Stat 882: Mathematical Statistics I (3 Credits)
\item
  Stat 850: Statistical Computing (2 Credits)
\item
  Stat 810: Alpha Seminar (1 Credit)
\end{itemize}

If you will have a Graduate Teaching Assistantship (GTA) you will also need to register for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Stat 892: TA Prep (1 Credit)
\end{itemize}

There are instances (for example if you already came in with a Master's in Statistics), where you may be able to waive some of these first semester courses and take other courses (though from my experience this is very rare). Please contact Dr.~Bert Clarke or Dr.~Steve Kachman for more details on this.

\hypertarget{registration}{%
\section{Registration}\label{registration}}

To register for classes, you can go to MYRED (\url{https://myred.nebraska.edu/}), which is a portal where you can register for classes and view your student account. I would recommend looking through this portal in order to get familiar with all of the things that can be done in here. Under the enrollment tab, click ``Search for Classes''. Find the classes that you want to enroll and click ``Add to Cart''. Once you have added all the necessary classes click on ``Shopping Cart''. Once in here click ``Proceed to Enrollment Checkout''. If you enroll in Stat 892: TA Prep, you will need a special permission code. To get that you must email Alison Reckewey in the front office. Additionally, if you are having issues enrolling in classes she is also the person you would want to contact.

Another way to register for classes is through the Enrollment Scheduler. A walkthrough on how to register this way can be found at: \url{https://registrar.unl.edu/student/registration/tutorials/\#enroll}.

The books that you will need can also be found in MYRED. Please make sure you buy these books as they will be good references your first semester and throughout your time in the program (There are pdf versions of most of these books, just know that if you decide to stay for the PhD and take the qualifying exam, you'll need a physical copy).

\hypertarget{international-student-training}{%
\section{International Student Training}\label{international-student-training}}

International graduate students for whom English is not their native language (and did not previously graduate with a degree from an university that teaches English) and who expect to receive instructional assignments must successfully complete the Institute for International Teaching Assistants. It is a requirement of your TA if you are an international student. The 2022 dates for this is August 1 to August 12, and registration must be submitted no later than June 30, 2022. Information on how to apply and what you should expect to learn in this training program can be found at: \url{https://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/professional-development/ita}

\hypertarget{unl}{%
\chapter{University of Nebraska}\label{unl}}

This section consists of items that you will want to take care of before classes start, and other useful information about UNL

\hypertarget{unl-id-card}{%
\section{UNL ID Card}\label{unl-id-card}}

Your NCard is your UNL photo identification card and is used campus-wide for many purposes including identification and access to buildings. Places that your NCard will get you access to includes the department after hours and on weekends, Campus Recreation Centers, the Nebraska Unions, and Husker sporting events. Purchases can be made using your NCard and the charges will appear on your Student Accounts Consolidated Bill found on MyRed. For example, purchases made at the any of the on campus dining options can be done using your NCard.

The Basic Steps for obtaining your NCard are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Submit a photo of yourself and fill out the application online
\item
  Pick up your NCard from the Ncard office (Room 121 of the Nebraska Union on City Campus). You will need to bring a state-issued ID in order to do so. There are special instructions on how to pick up your NCard when you fill out the application. I would recommend getting this done as soon as possible once you arrive to Lincoln as you don't want to be trying to get your NCard at the same time as all the undergraduates.
\item
  Set up NCard account: NCard needs to be activated before it can be used to make purchases.
\end{itemize}

Link to the NCard website to fill out application and read full list of places it can be used: \url{https://ncard.unl.edu}

\hypertarget{bus-pass}{%
\section{Bus Pass}\label{bus-pass}}

All students that pay student fees will receive a mobile bus pass for the academic school year. The StarTran bus service connects City, East, and the Nebraska Innovation campuses and is covered in the student fees. Instructions on how to download this mobile bus pass should be sent out in an email towards the beginning of the semester, but also can be found on the UNL parking services website (\url{https://parking.unl.edu/bus-riders-user-guide\#student-pass}) for instructions.

There are four bus routes around the campuses:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bus Route 22: Goes around city campus only
\item
  Bus Route 23: Goes around east campus only
\item
  Bus Route 24: Holdredge (Goes between east and city campus - clockwise)
\item
  Bus Route 25: Vine (Goes between east and city campus - counterclockwise)
\end{itemize}

Route 24 and 25 runs every 10 minutes from 7am-6pm M-F and every 20 minutes from 6pm-9pm. A list of stops and the schedule can be found on the link below. Additionally, there is an on-call van service M-F for after hours. From personal experience the buses tend to not be on schedule and can get overly crowded at specific times, so when traveling between campuses make sure to take this into account.

\textbf{This past year due to COVID-19, a bus pass was not required. I'm not quite sure if that will remain true for next school year, but the university will send an email closer to the beginning of the school year with that information}

Bus Website: \url{https://parking.unl.edu/campus-bus-service}

\hypertarget{parking-pass}{%
\section{Parking Pass}\label{parking-pass}}

Due to the location of Hardin Hall (where the Statistic Offices and many of your classes will be), most students in the department do not purchase a parking pass and instead park in the neighborhoods across the street.

However, if you do decide you would like to purchase a parking pass, more information can be found here: \url{https://parking.unl.edu/}\}\{Parking Pass Information

\hypertarget{sas-license}{%
\section{SAS License}\label{sas-license}}

SAS is a statistical software that if you are not familiar with quite yet, you soon will be as it is commonly used in your first semester of courses and throughout the program. In order to get this installed on your computer, first you must stop in and see Jules Meyers in the statistics main office (Hardin 340) in order to pay the license fee. It is \(\$60\) if pay using your NCard and \$65 if paying using cash or check. This can be paid using your NCard once it is activated, check, or exact cash. After this is paid, you will need to take your computer to see Steve Westerholt in 342A Hardin Hall so he can install SAS on your computer. This may take awhile so make sure that you have a couple of hours where you will not need your laptop. Make sure you bring your power cord with you as well. Additionally, I would recommend doing this the week before classes start, as Steve tends to be busy with SAS renewals the first week of class that may cause a backup. Also there has been some students using SAS onDemand, which is free for students (though as SAS is something you will be using a lot at least through your first year, it is easier to use it using the license).

Also as a heads up, SAS is easily installed on a PC, however if you have a MAC not as much. There are different options that Steve will brief you on when you give him your laptop.

\hypertarget{campus-wi-fi}{%
\section{Campus Wi-Fi}\label{campus-wi-fi}}

Another important thing to do when you arrive on campus is to set up your computer with the campus Wi-Fi. We usually go over this as a department before the first week of classes, however, instructions can be found at \url{https://its.unl.edu/services/wi-fi/} on how do to do this. This needs to be done before Steve can install SAS on your computer, and he should be able to help if you are having issues connecting to the Wi-Fi network.

\hypertarget{printing}{%
\section{Printing}\label{printing}}

If you have a PC, Steve Westerholt will be able to easily connect you to one of the printers within the department, which is very convenient. If you have a MAC, I'm sure this may still be able to be done, but I would talk to Steve to get more information on this.

\hypertarget{student-fees}{%
\section{Student Fees}\label{student-fees}}

Here is a list of the Mandatory Student Fees you should be aware of as listed on the Universities Website for the 2021-2022 academic year:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Registration Fee - \$20.00 (due each semester a student registers for classes)
\item
  Technology Fee - \$11.00 per credit hour
\item
  ID Card Fee - \$20.00 (One time fee assesed when pick up first NCard)
\item
  Library Fee - \$6.25 per credit hour
\item
  University Program/Facilities Fee - \$631.00
\item
  New International Graduate Fee - \$150.00 (One-time fee due the first semester an international graduate student is enrolled)
\item
  International Graduate Student Fee - \$70.00 (for every semester after the first)
\item
  There are also late fees for failing to pay you bill on time and if you register for classes late.
\end{itemize}

Optional Student Fees (This is updated for the 2021-2022 Academic Year):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Health Insurance Fall - \$1392.74
\item
  Health Insurance Spring/Summer - \$1930.42
\end{itemize}

Graduate students are automatically enrolled in the health insurance plan, so if you have your own health insurance you can opt out (You have until sometime in September to do this and will have to prove that you have health insurance). International students must be enrolled in university health insurance, cannot opt out most of the time for a personal insurance. Exceptions are rare and difficult to obtain.

If you have funding from the department, check your contract for a insurance coverage. It is common that included with an assistantship, a portion of the student health insurance premium will be covered.

More information on the Student Health Insurance:

Where student fee and tuition information should hopefully be updated: \url{https://studentaccounts.unl.edu/graduate-tuition\#ay_fee_block}

\hypertarget{university-health-center}{%
\section{University Health Center}\label{university-health-center}}

This section is more of an FYI, but UNL has a health center that offers many different services that may be of interest especially if you are not from Nebraska. For example, they offer primary care, pharmacy, dental services, immunization clinic, counseling and psychological services, and may others that are all located within a building on city campus. Some of these services are offered for free (like receiving a flu shot) and for others you either can use your student health insurance (things like check-ups would be completely covered), or if you have your own the university works with most insurance companies. More information can be found here: \url{https://health.unl.edu}

Additionally if you do not want to go to the health center, for dental services, the dental college on east campus offers dental services with one of their dental students for a significantly reduced cost.

\hypertarget{east-campus}{%
\section{East Campus}\label{east-campus}}

Unless you are teaching on City Campus, or taking a class out of the department, you will spend pretty much all of your time on East Campus.The University has put a lot of work into renovating parts of East Campus the last few years. Among these renovations is the East Campus Rec Center (need NCard to enter), the East Campus Union (has places to buy snacks and to study), and the Dinsdale Learning Commons (aka the library), which has a lot of places to study at. Additionally, there is an Arboretum with tables if you ever want to study outside. So don't feel like you have to spend all of your time in Hardin, and make use of some of these nice and rennovated facilities.

Most students seemed to have found an apartment by just googling ``apartments in Lincoln'', or looking through apartment rental sites like Zillow. Many apartments have been built in recent years, so it is pretty easy to find one (according to a student, you probably don't even have to start looking until 30-60 days in advance).

Here is the Information Page from Grad Studies about relocating to Lincoln for more helpful information: \url{https://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/admissions/relocate}

If you are interested in finding a roommate:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reach out to one of the Stat GSA officers and we will send out a message to see if any current students are looking for a roommate. Not gauranteed, but we will do our best to help connect you.
\item
  University of Nebraska Facebook Page
\item
  UNL CSSA (Chinese Student and Scholar Association) - has page on UNL website and a Facebook page.
\item
  If you are from India, the Indian Student Association (who has a facebook page) can help potentially connect you with a roommate and potential places to live.
\item
  Also, there's been multiple instances of people starting off by living alone, then moving in with friends they make in the department. So that may be an option later.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{furniture}{%

If you are in need of some new/used furniture, here are some recommendations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Facebook marketplace
\item
  OfferUp is a good app to find used furniture.
\item
  UNL CSSA Facebook Page

  UNL Buy and Sell Facebook Page
\item
  Goodwill
\item
  Ernie's in Ceresco
\item
  Craigslist
\item
  Walmart
\item
  Target
\item
  Furniture Row
\item
  Amazon: will probably have to do your own assembling, but a good option if you don't have a car
\item
  Nebraska Furniture Mart: located in Omaha and is a bit more on the expensive side compared to these other places, but it's really nice new furniture. It is a set of multiple buildings, and there is a clearance building called Mrs.~B's with discounted furniture. In most cases, for an additional fee, they can ship it to Lincoln and bring it into your housing for you.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  The Railyard: Across the street from Pinancle Bank Arena and has typically has live music on the weekends and watch parties for certain sporting events. Turns into an outdoor ice skating rink in the winter. Many events are hosted around here in the summer.
\item
  The Haymarket: bar and restaurant district
\item
  Many other bars on O and P street.
\end{itemize}

If you are a TA, the advice I was given on my tour was if you were worried about seeing your students while you were out, then stick to bars in the Haymarket area.

  Nebraska Cornhuskers

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Nebraska does not have any major league professional sports teams, so the locals tend to be pretty crazed for all things Huskers. I would not recommend trying to study on City Campus while there is a football game happening as there will be lots of people and no place to park
  \item
    Most home sporting events at UNL are free. Since COVID, you still have to go through the ticket portal to reserve a ticket, but there's nothing to pay). This includes baseball, softball, track and field, gymnastics, women's basketball, women's soccer, and wrestling. Please see the athletic departments website (linked below) for a full list of sports and their schedules. Sometimes will give away free items, like tshirts.
  \item
    Football, Men's Basketball and Volleyball are the three sports that you have to have student season tickets for. Typically information for securing student tickets goes out during the spring semester before the next academic school year. If you are unable to secure student season tickets or don't want to commit to a full season, check out The Iron N Student Ticket Exchange Facebook group. This is a place where students can sell a single game ticket if they are unable to attend. The ticket tab on the athletic department website will lead you to the student ticket portal where you would need to create an account to buy tickets and accept transferred tickets from another student. I recommend trying to attend a football game or volleyball game at least once while you are here even if you aren't a huge sports fan. It is defintely a Nebraskan cultural experience and great for people-watching! The volleyball team is typically ranked within the top 10 nationally and won a national championship in 2017. The football team is just trying to have a winning season at this point, but the games are still fun to attend.

Sometimes it can be difficult to find things to do in Lincoln (especially depending on how large of a city you are moving in from), so may need to be intentional about looking and somtimes may have to make your own fun!

The Stat GSA has a couple of different events throughout the year as a way to get to know your fellow students and hopefully have some fun!:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Monthly Happy Hours
\item
  Cultural Potluck: Once a semester we have a potluck where students bring food from their native country to share with department. There is a wonderful variety of food and there are quite a few good cooks within the department!
\item
  Study Breaks: About once a month, we have a study break where a couple of students are in charge of bringing snacks to share.
\item
  Spring Event: Typically we have a fun event in the spring as a celebration of the end of the year. In years past we have typically gone bowling, though this last spring we did go to Top Golf in Omaha!
\end{itemize}

More information on dates and location of these will be sent to your emails, so be sure to check those!

Additionally, we ask that each semester students pay \$5.00 in due money to go towards buying drinks for the potluck and to help pay for the Spring Event.

\hypertarget{advice}{%
\chapter{Advice from Current Graduate Students}\label{advice}}

What is one good tip you were given prior to Grad School?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Relax the summer before''
\item
  ``Don't stress about results, just enjoy the experience''
\item
  ``You will definitely be overwhelmed considering that it is a big leap from the undergrad studies. But everything will be fine''
\item
  ``MEAL PREPPING!''
\item
  ``Stay connected with others and the department''
\item
  ``Have a great balance between work and life. That means that no one should study ALL the time. Finding a hobby or hobbies will help with the stress of graduate school.''
\item
  ``You might need to re-learn how to study/do homework. It's a lot different from undergraduate!''
\item
  ``Don't take everything too seriously''
\item
  ``Make sure to make time for fun''
\item
  ``All the students are in this together. Work together. Ask each other questions. Help each other.''
\item
  ``There will come a time in class where you will have no clue what is going on. Don't panic, you are probably not the only one. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your classmates or professors.''
\item
  ``Make sure to allocate proper time for sleep (ie. choose sleep over cramming)''
\item
  ``Have a personal life. It's healthy to have a balance!''
\item
  ``Grad school is a team sport. Work together, learn more.''
\item
  ``Treat it like a job, go into the office during the workday. Just be around and you will make connections.''
\item
  ``Form a habit to search and read related paper by yourself''
\item
  ``Ask people to hang out. It's easy to be lonely.''
\end{itemize}

What is something you wish you had known before moving to Lincoln and beginning graduate school?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Should keep very organized notes that I can refer to later in the semester''
\item
  ``Managing a balanced life''
\item
  ``Public transport is not great, it would be useful to find housing near bus routes or have your own car.''
\item
  ``Lot of outdoor activities conducted by UNL outdoor adventure center, great way to make new friends who enjoy doing the same things as you. Beer tours at Zipline - good way of making friends outside of your academic circle. Lot of events are organized by different international students organizations - Malaysia night, India night, good way to meet new people.''
\item
  ``It's very important to form a cohort, even if that's not the people starting at the same time as you. Form study groups, find people you can ask questions or get advice from. Grad school is a collaborative experience!''
\item
  ``know and constantly communicate with everyone in your cohort. Makes everything easier''
\item
  ``Making new friends takes effort. Work hard to deepen friendships. Also, they don't plow residential roads.''
\item
  ``Enjoy this time to learn and meet new friends. Many people will be your future colleagues and those who will remain in your life for the extended future.''
\item
  ``Get creative with your coursework and projects. Take classes in the computer science, or economics department. Don't just stick with the normal classes. Go above and beyond.''
\item
  ``This experience is what you make of it. If you don't put in the work to get to know your fellow students and faculty, and attend events hosted by either the gsa or department, the experience probably won't be as fun. It's also a chance to network with people who will be your peers.''
\item
  ``Make time to prioritize fun activities during grad school. Lincoln is a nice sized town with a lot to do - seek it out!''
\item
  ``Bring more thick clothes like down jacket, winter in Lincoln can be very cold''
\item
  ``The wind is strong''
\item
  ``I wish I had known that working with others would become commonplace. It's honestly been a difficult transition for me. Also, Lincoln can be difficult to find stuff to do at times, in my opinion.''
\item
  ``Grades are irrelevant (learning is more important), it's a better use of time to work on more projects than spend time on improving grades.''
\item
  ``Advisor shop - go talk to a handful of professors about their research and potential projects before selecting an advisor. Find someone who fits both your interests and personality.''
\item
  ``Introduce yourself to people and make friends. Everyone is very friendly.''
\item
  ``If you are coming from Asia, buy Casella and Berger at home before coming to the US. Wayyy cheaper.''
\item
  ``Join the American Statistical Association and find the community threads that are of interest to you. This is how you will make a lot of connections.''
\end{itemize}

This was touched upon above, but no matter if you plan on just getting a Master's or getting the PhD, it is important to find an advisor. This isn't something you need to do right away, but I would try and find one by the end of your first year, as this will help make sure you are doing everything you need to do in order to graduate and be successful after graduation. So during your first semester, I would try and talk to a bunch of different professors about their research interests so you can pinpoint one that has research you are interested in and you can work with well. Sounds scary, but will be very helpful to do in the long run.
